# TBSPG
TBSPG pipeline can automatically trim the reads, run the mapping, remove the shared reads among Mitochondria (mit), Chloroplast (chl) and Chromosomes (chr), sort, and  deduplicate the alignment map, then count the number of reads (readsno.txt) and coverage (cov.txt), using entire or half length, pair-end or single reads.
